Current Issues
- Entities spawning over ores despite logic to prevent this (ores maybe added after my check via other mods)

Potential Improvements
- Deploy script - Update forums and mod portal with latest version
- Git tag hook - Run deploy script when git tag in format vX.X.X
- Test game with Multi-Force PvP games?
- Item-group hide from players
- Balancing: Crafting speed, power, pollution, recipe factor
- Balancing: Rarer as distance gets further? Multiple types of machines based on distance? Tech to enhance machines?
- Algorithm improvement to distance check to improve performance
- Compatability with faster loaders
- Icons for item-group mod support
- Recipe localization for mods
- Switch to deepcopy from util
- Loader cleanup logic? Just in case entity is destroyed without removing loaders?

Suggestions from users and other random ideas that may or may not happen
- Create giant miners (with infinite ore patches)
- Add giant refineries
- Add giant beacons that increase belt speed
- Split giant chemical plants from assembly machines
- Make them buildable with research
- Make crafting bonus research (To increase power consumption would have to make a number of prototypes for each possible power level)
- Make research that controls number of available loaders
- Start with 2 furnances in spawn
- Make "destroyed" entities turn into a repairable structure
- Make structures only destroyable by cliff explosives
- Lock in some recipes for machines
- Create whitelist/blacklist for lua surfaces using LuaRemote for other mods to stop these on their mod
